## 3. Industry Best Practices & Competitive Analysis

To create a world-class system, we analyzed the user management features of industry leaders:

### Binance:

- **Workspace Member Management:** Admins can add users via email invitation [1].
- **Role-Based Access:** Different roles (Admin, Developer) with specific permissions [1].
- **Complete Control:** Admin panel provides full control over user management, transaction tracking, and platform settings [2].

### Interactive Brokers:

- **User Roles:** Create custom user roles with specific access rights [3].
- **User Creation:** Add new users with their own username/password [4].
- **Email Verification:** New users receive an email to confirm their information and change their password [4].

### Key Takeaways:

- **Email Invitations:** The standard for professional user onboarding.
- **Custom Roles:** Granular control over user permissions.
- **Self-Service:** Users complete their own profiles after invitation.
- **Security:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and email verification are essential.
