Trading platform UI design - what to focus on

To create a trading platform whose interface gives your users the freedom to quickly and securely execute their transactions, the primary focus should be on designing a seamless and not-too-overcomplicated experience. First of all, consider incorporating these features:

Market updates
Advanced ordering and research tools
Visual data representation
Financial calculators
Automated trading advisors

Navigation plays another crucial role in platform usability. 

Frequently used options should be prominently placed in headers, while less common functions can reside in footers. This way, you can easily access key features while maintaining a clean interface.

And don’t forget the customization! 

Offer analytic tools to help your users understand market conditions and develop strategies. Consider also integrating with customized bots for investment apps. Additionally, give timely notifications and comprehensive research tools so your traders can stay informed and make better decisions.
