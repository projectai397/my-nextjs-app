Binance UI Refined: Explore the New Flexible Layout System
2025-06-20
Main Takeaways

Binance UI Refined is a redesigned Pro Mode experience in the Binance App, giving you a cleaner, more customisable homepage experience.

The new flexible grid system lets you organise, resize, and personalise your homepage with widgets that suit your style.

Customisable widgets live inside the grid, while fixed banners and tickers ensure key updates and tools remain visible to all users.

This is a general announcement. Products and services referred to here may not be available in your region.

The new Binance UI Refined homepage gives you more flexibility and more control — without adding complexity. At the heart of this redesign is a flexible grid system that lets you organise your Pro Mode app homepage the way you want it.

It’s designed to help you focus on the tools and insights that matter most, while keeping key information easy to access. In this blog, we’ll explore how the flexible layout system works, how it balances customisable widgets with essential fixed elements, and how this update helps streamline your experience.

Introducing the Flexible Grid System

At the core of the new homepage is a modular flexible grid that gives you greater control over your trading space. You can drag, resize, and organise widgets across this grid to create a layout that fits your personal style and trading needs.

Whether you want a simple, focused setup or a more detailed dashboard, the system adjusts to you. Layout templates and animated guidance help you get started quickly, making it easy for any user to tailor their homepage experience.

This is about more than visual customisation. The grid is designed to put you in control and deliver an experience that feels clear, intuitive, and personal — helping you focus on what matters most. And as your trading habits evolve, your layout can evolve with them, giving you the freedom to shape an experience that works the way you do.

Adjustable Widgets vs Fixed Elements

The new layout brings flexibility and clarity to your homepage. Some elements are fully customisable, while others are designed to remain consistent for all users.

Adjustable Widgets

The flexible grid is built to hold customisable widgets that you can easily add, remove, move, and resize. These widgets provide real-time, actionable insights — from market data and price trends to sentiment signals and more. We’ll take a deeper look at the full widgets library in the next blog in this series.

Fixed Elements

Alongside the flexible grid, certain elements remain in fixed positions outside the widget area. These banners and tickers are there to ensure that all users can access important information such as onboarding guides, key campaigns, trusted deposit options, and timely market updates. By keeping these elements consistent, the layout helps maintain a clear and reliable user experience across the board.

Fixed Elements Explained

While the flexible grid gives you control over your widget layout, certain fixed elements remain consistent across all Pro Mode homepages. These banners ensure that essential information and key features are always visible and easy to access.

1 /  Asset Performance Overview: A collapsible banner that helps you track the performance of assets in your portfolio. It displays AUM and PnL% across multiple time windows (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 180 days, and 360 days), giving you a clear view of how your holdings are performing over time.

2 / New User Onboarding Banner: A fixed banner designed to help new users. It introduces key features and provides helpful guidance, with a clear, standardised placement on the homepage.

3/ Featured Opportunities Banner: A rotating banner that surfaces active campaigns and opportunities, such as onboarding tasks; special promos; Launchpool events; pre-market offerings; new listings; Copy Trading; plus Simple Earn Flexible options.

Final Thoughts: Why This Refined UI/UX Matters

The new homepage layout is designed to give you greater control without adding complexity. By combining a flexible grid with thoughtfully placed fixed elements, it ensures your experience remains adaptable and easy to navigate.

The flexible grid puts you in charge of your core trading space, allowing you to organise your homepage around the tools, data, and insights that best match your style. At the same time, banners and tickers provide a consistent layer of essential info, from key updates and educational content to trusted deposit options and active campaigns.

This update isn’t about introducing new products that you need to learn from scratch. It’s a focused UI/UX enhancement that makes the Pro Mode app homepage clearer, more intuitive, and better aligned with the way you trade. Your homepage; your way.
